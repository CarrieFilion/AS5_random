## Ideas

- Create a **live auction for spectra**. The interface is: Choose your instrument, your observing conditions, exposure time, time constraints, and so on, and a *maximum amount* you are willing to pay for one spectrum (the bid). At every interval (15 minutes, say), we find the telescope pointing and field configurations that maximize revenue. We charge a discounted rate to the bids, which is discounted because we bill a total amount to all the winning bids that delivers to us a total revenue that is halfway between the best field's total of bids and the second-best field's total of bids (I believe there is research about this structure). *&mdash; Hogg*

- **Follow the *LSST* footprint**, by some sparse sampling. Operate a time-domain survey that is always pointing at a field that was observed by *LSST* within the last *N* minutes. Permits all-sky survey targets and also *LSST*-triggered target-of-opportunity targets in the same program. Could be combined with the live auction idea above. *&mdash; Hogg*
